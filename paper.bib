abstract ={Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student?who was randomly assigned either a male or female name?for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants? preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

The imaging modalities will include diffusion imaging (dMRI), resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI), task-evoked fMRI (T-fMRI), T1- and T2-weighted \{MRI\} for structural and myelin mapping, plus combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG). Given the importance of obtaining the best possible data quality, we discuss the efforts underway during the first two years of the grant (Phase I) to refine and optimize many aspects of \{HCP\} data acquisition, including a new 7T scanner, a customized 3T scanner, and improved \{MR\} pulse sequences.

Children move more than adults and this has led to concerns that developmental changes in resting-state connectivity measures may be artefactual. Furthermore, children are challenging to recruit into studies and therefore researchers have tended to take a permissive stance when setting exclusion criteria on head motion. The literature is not clear regarding our central question: How much motion is too much? Here, we systematically examine the effects of multiple motion exclusion criteria at different sample sizes and age ranges in a large openly available developmental cohort (ABIDE; http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide). We checked 1) the reliability of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) pairwise connectivity measures across the brain and 2) the accuracy with which we can separate participants with autism spectrum disorder from typically developing controls based on their rs-fMRI scans using machine learning. We find that reliability on average is primarily sensitive to the number of participants considered, but that increasingly permissive motion thresholds lower case-control prediction accuracy for all sample sizes.},

This is not due to the fundamental difficulty and complexity of the process, but is a result of the fact that the neccessary tools were developed for and by neuroimaging researchers. This project describes a publically available utility implemented as a Docker image that takes a structural MRI as input, and gives files for 3D printing as output, along with a rendered image of the surface.},

                 becoming increasingly prominent in the conduct of research.
                 PURPOSE: This paper reports on a quasi-experimental
                 longitudinal study conducted to compare bibliometric
                 indicators of scientific collaboration, productivity, and
                 impact of center-based transdisciplinary team science
                 initiatives and traditional investigator-initiated grants in
                 the same field. METHODS: All grants began between 1994 and
                 2004 and up to 10 years of publication data were collected for
                 each grant. Publication information was compiled and analyzed
                 during the spring and summer of 2010. RESULTS: Following an
                 initial lag period, the transdisciplinary research center
                 grants had higher overall publication rates than the
                 investigator-initiated R01 (NIH Research Project Grant
                 Program) grants. There were relatively uniform publication
                 rates across the research center grants compared to
                 dramatically dispersed publication rates among the R01 grants.
                 On average, publications produced by the research center
                 grants had greater numbers of coauthors but similar journal
                 impact factors compared with publications produced by the R01
                 grants. CONCLUSIONS: The lag in productivity among the
                 transdisciplinary center grants was offset by their overall
                 higher publication rates and average number of coauthors per
                 publication, relative to investigator-initiated grants, over
                 the 10-year comparison period. The findings suggest that
                 transdisciplinary center grants create benefits for both
                 scientific productivity and collaboration.",

  abstract = "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge
              for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence,
              lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing
              these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts.
              Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for
              these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we
              introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)-a
              grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112
              existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and
              phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573
              age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7-64 years)
              (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we
              present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for
              advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360
              male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused
              on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey
              a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain
              architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate
              themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature;
              both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated,
              particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional
              connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional
              metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of
              dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior
              cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions
              such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets
              provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and
              novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets,
              ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the
              stage for the next generation of ASD studies.",
