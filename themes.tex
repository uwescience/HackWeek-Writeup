\section*{Themes}

To date, all hack weeks we have organized have been subject-specific, i.e.\ aimed at bringing together a community with a shared scientific interest, such as neuroscience.
Advantages of this approach include shared language and scientific objectives within communities organized by subject, leaving more time for active collaboration on cutting-edge science.
On the other hand, homogeneity may lead to \textit{group think} and inhibit new, creative solutions.
In this case, it may be advantageous to design a hack week around a technique (e.g.\ Gaussian Processes) or modality (e.g.\ imaging), such as the ImageXD (image processing across domains\footnote{\url{http://http://www.imagexd.org/}}) meetings.
For these events, building a shared vocabulary and shared understanding of major data analysis problems is crucial, but they also allow for cross-disciplinary diffusion of techniques into other subjects and therefore decrease the risk of duplication of method development efforts.
