%Spelling must be British English (Oxford English Dictionary)

%In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the
%following:
%\begin{enumerate}
% \item A 100 word or less summary indicating on scientific grounds
%why the paper should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like
%\textsl{Nature} instead of a more narrowly focussed journal.
% \item A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience,
%written at the level of a national newspaper.  It may be used for
%\textsl{Nature}'s press release or other general publicity.
% \item The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the
%submission, including number of figures, supporting manuscripts
%and any Supplementary Information (specifying number of items and
%format).
% \item The cover letter should also state the number of
%words of text in the paper; the number of figures and parts of
%figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising 16 separate panels in
%total); a rough estimate of the desired final size of figures in
%terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
%telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.
%\end{enumerate}

%See \textsl{Nature}'s website
%(\texttt{http://www.nature.com/nature/submit/gta/index.html}) for
%complete submission guidelines.

%\begin{methods}
%Put methods in here.  If you are going to subsection it, use

%800 words and if it is less than 200 words, it can be incorporated
%into the main text.

% to 30.
