\section*{What is a hack week?}

%Our hack weeks combine structured, tutorial-style instruction with informal education and peer learning opportunities occurring within projects and hacks. Additionally, they provide opportunities to build new collaborations and network.
Our hack weeks combine structured, tutorial-style instruction with open-ended project work, providing opportunities for peer learning, networking, and for building collaborations.
In a space spanned by pedagogical focus as one dimension and focus on project work as the other, the hack weeks we have organized are designed to lie somewhere in between traditional summer schools and hackathons, where we believe they fill a space not currently fully addressed by existing models (Figure \ref{fig:hackspectrum}).

The hackathon, a time-bounded, collaborative event that brings together participants around a shared challenge or learning objective \cite{Decker2015}, forms one primary axis of our events.
Hackathons originated from the open-source software movement and have historically focused on software and technology development.
In recent years hackathons have evolved into a model providing opportunities for intensive, interdisciplinary collaboration \cite{Groen2015-cj} and education \cite{Kienzler2015-zu,Lamers2014-xf} in the sciences.
Core elements of hackathons include opportunities for networking, strengthening social ties, and building community connections, both within and across disciplines.
Building on these core elements, hackathons have been implemented in different ways depending on the overall purpose, mode of participation, style of work environment and participant motivation \cite{Drouhard2017}.
%``Catalytic'' hackathons seek novel project ideas aimed at solving a tractable, well-defined challenge.
%``Contributive'' hackathons seek to improve to an existing effort through focused work on discrete tasks, for example to make up for deficiencies in an ongoing project.
%Finally, ``Communal'' hackathons place a strong focus on building a culture of practice and developing resources within an existing community, often defined by a specific domain of knowledge.

Summer schools have been designed to excel in transfer of knowledge from experts in the field to (early-career) researchers: they often serve as an entry point for scientists who aim to expand their research into a new area or switch fields. They are excellent at giving participants a reasonably deep understanding of a topic or field in a short amount of time. Within this concept, learning can take many forms, including traditional lecture formats but also hands-on project work, often in teams (e.g., Advanced Course on Computational Neuroscience, Okinawa Computational Neuroscience Course, Woods Hole Computational Neuroscience Summer course).

Our hack weeks extend the scientifically-focused, communal hackathon model into a space that includes a strong element of pedagogy and peer learning. They aim to synthesize different goals and strategies from both models: they are more participant-driven than a summer school, but have a stronger focus on pedagogy than a hackathon. Where a summer school is often organized around a framework of lectures and tutorials known in advance, hack weeks leave the majority of time to be designed by participants, under careful facilitation of the organizers. Tutorials at hack weeks often serve as an entry point into a topic for further exploration and learning. %This is closely related to the nature of the material taught at these events. Data science is a new, emerging area combining knowledge and skills from many different fields, only a fraction of which can be communicated within a short tutorial. As organizers, we make a curated selection of a small number of tutorials each year, and encourage participants to use the unstructured time to self-organize tutorials on any topic as needed.%, often on topics vastly different to those discussed in the formal lectures.

Hack weeks uniquely allow organizers to tailor the content of the workshop to the needs of the participants in an ad-hoc fashion, including the number and content of tutorials. This way, the group as a whole can respond quickly or react to unforeseen challenges and opportunities. They encourage participants to self-organize in many different forms: experts working with other experts, mentoring relationships between experts and non-experts, or study groups among non-experts, to name but a few. Hack weeks also allow participants to experiment with projects and ideas beyond their day-to-day research: For example, our hack weeks explicitly encourage projects around outreach and work aimed at improving the scientific community itself.

There is, however, a major risk in the lack of focus: by wanting to do many things at once, a hack week might potentially not do any of them well. Because tutorials are not necessarily the major focus of a hack week, the knowledge gained by participants in these tutorials may be shallow. A hack week carries a much larger risk of failure if objectives and expectations are not set by organizers well in advance, and clearly communicated to participants, because they often require significant preparation from the side of participants.
Because of these risks, organizers face a much larger degree of uncertainty, and need to be prepared to focus much of their energy on thoughtful selection and management of participants, and facilitation of the large range of different types of activities at any given time (see also the SM, Section 4.2.4).

We note that the terminology for these events is constantly evolving, and that the ``hackathon'' concept may have implicit connotations that are disfavored in some communities. We also note that all of these events live on a constantly changing continuum, depending on the requirements of the scientific domain within which they live. For example, Neuro Hack Week is moving toward a more traditional summer school model, while Astro Hack Week has strengthened its focus on projects and hacks in recent iterations.
