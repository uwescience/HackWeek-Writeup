\significancestatement{As scientific disciplines grapple with more data sets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a new type of scientific workshop, called a \textit{hack week}, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities, and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience and geoscience, and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results and improve attitudes toward open science and reproducibility.}

%\section*{Guide to using this template on Overleaf}

%Please note that whilst this template provides a preview of the typeset manuscript for submission, to help in this preparation, it will not necessarily be the final publication layout. For more detailed information please see the \href{http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/format.xhtml}{PNAS Information for Authors}.

%If you have a question while using this template on Overleaf, please use the help menu (``?'') on the top bar to search for \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help}{help and tutorials}. You can also \href{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}{contact the Overleaf support team} at any time with specific questions about your manuscript or feedback on the template.

%\subsection*{Author Affiliations}

%Include department, institution, and complete address, with the ZIP/postal code, for each author. Use lower case letters to match authors with institutions, as shown in the example. Authors with an ORCID ID may supply this information at submission.

%\subsection*{Submitting Manuscripts}

%All authors must submit their articles at \href{http://www.pnascentral.org/cgi-bin/main.plex}{PNAScentral}. If you are using Overleaf to write your article, you can use the ``Submit to PNAS'' option in the top bar of the editor window.

%\subsection*{Format}

%Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the following order of sections;  Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords, Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are permitted.

%\subsection*{Manuscript Length}

%PNAS generally uses a two-column format averaging 67 characters, including spaces, per line. The maximum length of a Direct Submission research article is six pages and a PNAS PLUS research article is ten pages including all text, spaces, and the number of characters displaced by figures, tables, and equations.  When submitting tables, figures, and/or equations in addition to text, keep the text for your manuscript under 39,000 characters (including spaces) for Direct Submissions and 72,000 characters (including spaces) for PNAS PLUS.

%\subsection*{References}

%References should be cited in numerical order as they appear in text; this will be done automatically via bibtex, e.g. \cite{belkin2002using} and \cite{berard1994embedding,coifman2005geometric}. All references, including for the SI, should be included in the main manuscript file. References appearing in both sections should not be duplicated.  SI references included in tables should be included with the main reference section.

%\subsection*{Data Archival}

%PNAS must be able to archive the data essential to a published article. Where such archiving is not possible, deposition of data in public databases, such as GenBank, ArrayExpress, Protein Data Bank, Unidata, and others outlined in the Information for Authors, is acceptable.

%\subsection*{Language-Editing Services}
%Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use a language-editing service (see list at www.pnas.org/site/authors/language-editing.xhtml). PNAS does not take responsibility for or endorse these services, and their use has no bearing on acceptance of a manuscript for publication.

%\label{fig:frog}
%\end{figure}

%\subsection*{Digital Figures}
%\label{sec:figures}

%Only TIFF, EPS, and high-resolution PDF for Mac or PC are allowed for figures that will appear in the main text, and images must be final size. Authors may submit U3D or PRC files for 3D images; these must be accompanied by 2D representations in TIFF, EPS, or high-resolution PDF format.  Color images must be in RGB (red, green, blue) mode. Include the font files for any text.

%Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.

%Figure \ref{fig:frog} shows an example of how to insert a column-wide figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment. Figures wider than one column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide.

%\subsection*{Single column equations}

%Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to their preference.

%To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment mentioned above for figures, or to use the \verb|\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}| environment as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

%Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and footnotes, as mentioned in the \href{http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted}{cuted package documentation}. In the case of problems with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using commands \verb|\footnotemark| and \verb|\footnotetext|.

%\subsection*{Supporting Information (SI)}

%The main text of the paper must stand on its own without the SI. Refer to SI in the manuscript at an appropriate point in the text. Number supporting figures and tables starting with S1, S2, etc. Authors are limited to no more than 10 SI files, not including movie files. Authors who place detailed materials and methods in SI must provide sufficient detail in the main text methods to enable a reader to follow the logic of the procedures and results and also must reference the online methods. If a paper is fundamentally a study of a new method or technique, then the methods must be described completely in the main text. Because PNAS edits SI and composes it into a single PDF, authors must provide the following file formats only.

%\subsubsection*{SI Text}

%Supply Word, RTF, or LaTeX files (LaTeX files must be accompanied by a PDF with the same file name for visual reference).

%\subsubsection*{SI Figures}

%Provide a brief legend for each supporting figure after the supporting text. Provide figure images in TIFF, EPS, high-resolution PDF, JPEG, or GIF format; figures may not be embedded in manuscript text. When saving TIFF files, use only LZW compression; do not use JPEG compression. Do not save figure numbers, legends, or author names as part of the image. Composite figures must be pre-assembled.

%\subsubsection*{3D Figures}

%Supply a composable U3D or PRC file so that it may be edited and composed. Authors may submit a PDF file but please note it will be published in raw format and will not be edited or composed.

%\subsubsection*{SI Tables}

%Supply Word, RTF, or LaTeX files (LaTeX files must be accompanied by a PDF with the same file name for visual reference); include only one table per file. Do not use tabs or spaces to separate columns in Word tables.

%\subsubsection*{SI Datasets}

%Supply Excel (.xls), RTF, or PDF files. This file type will be published in raw format and will not be edited or composed.

%\subsubsection*{SI Movies}

%Supply Audio Video Interleave (avi), Quicktime (mov), Windows Media (wmv), animated GIF (gif), or MPEG files and submit a brief legend for each movie in a Word or RTF file. All movies should be submitted at the desired reproduction size and length. Movies should be no more than 10 MB in size.

%\subsubsection*{Still images}

%Authors must provide a still image from each video file. Supply TIFF, EPS, high-resolution PDF, JPEG, or GIF files.

%\subsubsection*{Appendices}

%PNAS prefers that authors submit individual source files to ensure readability. If this is not possible, supply a single PDF file that contains all of the SI associated with the paper. This file type will be published in raw format and will not be edited or composed.

\matmethods{
We performed post-attendance surveys for AHW, GHW and NHW in 2016 and 2017. All surveys contained general questions about attitudes towards the workshop as well as open science and reproducibility, and their own skills in statistical and computational methods, shared among all three surveys. The NHW and GHW surveys and the AHW 2017 survey were administered on site on the last day of the workshop; AHW participants in 2016 were e-mailed immediately after the workshop, with reminders after several weeks. All responses were collected within four weeks of the end of the workshop. The experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at UW, NYU and UC Berkeley. All participants gave their informed consent.

Response rates for NHW (2016: 41 responses; 2017: 45 responses) and GHW (2016: 42 responses; 2017: 41 responses) were 100\% in both years; the response rate for AHW was 71\% (35 out of 49) in 2016 and 82\% (37 out of 45) in 2017. The lower response rates for AHW can be explained by the generally lower rates of response for time-delayed survey in 2016. In 2017, a number of participants did not attend the full week, and thus several attendees were not present on the last day when the survey was administered. For the AHW surveys, we checked whether the demographics of the respondents different significantly from those of the attendees overall in three relevant categories (career stage, racial/ethnic background and gender identity) and find no significant difference after grouping responses in demographic categories, in order to improve the number of participants per category and response. We grouped responses in the career stage category into ``early-career'' (students and postdoctoral fellows), ``late-career'' (faculty, research scientists) and ``other'' (e.g. participants from outside academia). For race/ethnicity and gender, we grouped participants into ``minority'' (with respect to the field) and ``non-minority'' participants. Note that demographic data for GHW and NHW is only available for 2016, for AHW for both 2016 and 2017.

Participants were asked to respond to statements regarding these topics using a six-point Likert-type scale. All questions were anonymously recorded. No responses were discarded, and no pre-processing was performed on the data. We test for correlations between categorical variables using a standard $\chi^2$ test and compute the effect sizes via a bias-corrected version of Cram\'{e}r's V \citep{bergsma2013}, denoted $\phi_c$ in the manuscript. For a fairly permissive significant threshold of $\alpha < 0.05$, we require a $p$-value of $p < 0.0007$, corrected for $N_\mathrm{trials} = 36$ trials, to claim a significant effect as well as at least a small effect size according to \citet{cohen1988}. The full analysis procedure is available online\footnote{See the repository: \url{https://github.com/uwescience/HackWeek-Writeup}}.
